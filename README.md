Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
Notistack: For displaying snackbar notifications.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the UI.

Backend

Node.js: Runtime environment for the server.
Express.js: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
MySQL: Database for storing book information.
mysql2: MySQL client for Node.js.

Database

Table: bookInfo
Columns: bId (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment), title (VARCHAR), author (VARCHAR), publishYear (INT)



Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MySQL (v8 or higher)
Git (for cloning the repository)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/book-keeping-application.git
cd book-keeping-application


Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend


Install dependencies:
npm install


Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=book_db
PORT=3456




Configure the database:

Create a MySQL database named book_db:
CREATE DATABASE book_db;


Update backend/config/database.js to use environment variables:
const mysql = require("mysql2");
require("dotenv").config();

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
});

connection.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error connecting to database:", err.message);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Connected to MySQL database");
});

module.exports = connection;


Create the bookInfo table:
CREATE TABLE bookInfo (
  bId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  publishYear INT NOT NULL
);


(Optional) Insert sample data:
INSERT INTO bookInfo (title, author, publishYear)
VALUES ('Sample Book', 'John Doe', 2020);






Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory (root):
cd ..


Install dependencies:
npm install




Run the Application:

Start the backend server:
cd backend
node server.js


The server will run on http://localhost:3456 (or the port specified in .env).


Start the frontend development server:
cd ..
npm start


The app will open at http://localhost:3000.





Usage

Home Page:
Visit http://localhost:3000/ to see a list of all books in table or card format.


View a Book:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/showBook/<id> (e.g., /showBook/1) to view book details.


Create a Book:
Go to http://localhost:3000/createBook to add a new book.


Edit a Book:
Go to http://localhost:3000/editBook/<id> (e.g., /editBook/1) to update book details.


Delete a Book:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/deleteBook/<id> to remove a book.


Error Handling:
Invalid inputs, missing books, or server errors will display snackbar notifications and error messages.
